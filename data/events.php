During the Fishing Tournaments, the player\'s villagers will be seen fishing across town in fishing gear. Unlike New Leaf, they do not serve as competition and are not awarded trophies following the conclusion of the tournament.
Scoring

In a departure from previous tourneys, the players will have 3 minutes to catch as many fish as they can. Every fish is valued at one point and can be sold or retrieved from the cooler at the end of the timer. The player will receive 2 bonus points for catching more than 3 fish. For playing co-op, if 5 fish are caught between all players on the island there will be an additional 5 points awarded to every player, even if they did not catch any fish. If you are playing of a friend‘s island, you will receive twice as many points.

Points earned from tourneys can be redeemed for fishing swag with C.J., with each swag item costing 10 points. There are a total of 13 items to collect, and the player will receive a different one until all 13 have been rewarded, after which subsequent prizes will be random repeats. In addition, after achieving a net 100 points, C.J. will mail a bronze fishing tourney trophy to the player\'s home the next day, while 200 points awards a silver trophy and 300 points awards a gold trophy.

    'description' => 'In New Horizons

Bunny Day is the first seasonal event to occur after New Horizons\'s release, and unlike in previous installments, lasts multiple days from 1st of April, 2020 to 12th of April, 2020 . Zipper appears on on the island on the first day to tell the player about the event and give the Bunny Day bed recipe; if the player misses Zipper, the recipe will arrive in the mail the next day.

As before, there are 6 types of eggs to collect, Sky (Found hanging on multicolored balloons), Water (Found via fishing), Leaf (found in groups of 3 on trees and needs to be shaken off), Stone (Found by hitting a rock with a axe or shovel), Earth (Found in the ground like fossils), and Wood (Found occasionally by hitting a tree with a axe). These eggs are used to craft items in a new series, the ¨Bunny Day Series.¨ Like in New Leaf, the eggs can be eaten, which provides stamina in the same way as eating any fruit.

Players can also learn unique DIY recipes for a hat, dress, and shoes themed around each type of egg after collecting a certain amount of eggs of that type. Collecting all of the egg-themed costume recipes unlocks the recipe for Egg party hat and Egg party dress.

These DIY recipes can be found in a few different ways:

    In presents tied to multicolored balloons in the sky (the same ones that drop sky eggs), needing a slingshot to get them. This seems to be the most efficient way of gaining recipes as about 1/3 of the multicolored balloons will be a recipe.
    In a multicolored variant of the message in a bottle called an Egg message bottle.
    From villagers who upon seeing the player have an ! above their head and run towards them.
    Four recipes (Bunny Day bed, Bunny Day arch, Wobbling Zipper toy, and Bunny Day wand) can only be obtained from Zipper himself. 

On Bunny Day, Zipper will be present in the Resident Services plaza and all villagers will be dressed in egg costumes when they are outdoors. The player can obtain the Bunny Day arch recipe by speaking to Zipper. From then on, Zipper will also allow the player to trade in 3 of any type of egg for 1 of any other type, and also exchange 1 of each type of egg together for a Bunny Day basket furniture item, which has no DIY recipe.

Upon finding and crafting every single Bunny Day DIY recipe, including the Bunny Day arch, talking to Zipper again will reward the Wobbling Zipper toy recipe. After crafting that recipe and returning to Zipper for a third time, the player will receive the final prize of the event: the Bunny Day wand recipe.',

The event is hosted by Flick. While Flick is present on the island, he will also buy any other bugs that the player wants to sell. Unlike his regular random appearances, he does not offer crafted models of specific bugs provided by the player during the Bug Off. Flick accepts Bug Off entries between 9am and 6pm, and remains at his tent to buy bugs and redeem points for prizes until 8pm. The first competition of the day is free, but the player can participate in more competitions until the deadline by paying an entry fee of 500 Bells for each one.

During the Bug Off, the player\'s villagers will be seen wandering the island with their nets in search of bugs. Unlike New Leaf, they do not serve as competition and are not awarded trophies following the conclusion of the tournament.
Scoring

In a departure from previous Bug Offs the players will have 3 minutes to catch as many bugs as they can. Every bug is valued at one point and can be sold or retrieved from the bug cage at the end of the timer. The player will receive 2 bonus points for catching more than 3 bugs. For playing co-op, if 5 bugs are caught between all players on the island there will be an additional 5 points awarded to every player, even if they did not catch any bugs. Players participating on a friend\'s island will receive twice as many points.

Points earned from Bug Offs can be redeemed for bug swag with Flick, with each swag item costing 10 points. There are a total of 13 items to collect, and the player will receive a different one until all 13 have been rewarded, after which subsequent prizes will be random repeats. In addition, after achieving a net 100 points, Flick will mail a bronze Bug Off trophy to the player\'s home the next day, while 200 points awards a silver trophy and 300 points awards a gold trophy. Flick will save any of the player\'s unspent points for future Bug Off days. ',

As the first part of the two-part New Year celebration, this holiday is the climax of each year. Tortimer hosts an outdoor countdown party for the villagers in town. The day following the celebration is New Year\'s Day, the second part of the New Year celebration.

In New Leaf, Redd appears at the countdown clock and sells hats. Similarly, in Dōbutsu no Mori, Redd took up a similar role.

The holiday is analogous with the real world holiday of the same name. The villagers in the town will get excited about this event and how they celebrate it varies in all the different Animal Crossing games. Traditionally in many western countries, people sing "Auld Lang Syne," a practice mirrored by the villagers in Animal Forest. Translated from Scots, the song\'s title means "Times Gone By."',
